> 🚀 A powerful VS Code extension to navigate, generate, and export your project’s folder structure — with smart `.gitignore` integration and advanced filtering.

---

## ✨ Features

  Right-click any folder to create a neat tree view of your directory structure.
  Automatically saves it to a configurable `.txt` file (default: `structure.txt`).

* ✅ **Create File & Update .gitignore:**
  Create new files (even inside nested folders) with an option to automatically add them to the nearest `.gitignore`.

* ✅ **Custom Structure Generation:**
  Generate specialized structures by:

  * Including hidden files
  * Filtering by specific file extensions
  * Excluding folders

* ✅ **Convenient output options:**

  * Open the generated file immediately in VS Code
  * Copy structure to clipboard with a single click
